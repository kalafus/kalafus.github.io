# Privacy Policy — I Needs MA Meetings
**Effective: August 16, 2025**

---

## ✅ No Collection
We do not collect, transmit, or share any information from you or your device. Not personal information, not technical data, not metadata. Nothing.

We interpret the second part of the Eleventh Tradition — “_We need guard with special care the anonymity of all fellow MA members._” — as binding us never to do so. Here’s why we take that position:

Many services say they “protect” data while still collecting so-called pseudonymous information — device versions, locations, IP addresses, or identifiers that can be re-combined (_fingerprinting_) by big tech companies to track people with surprising accuracy. We don’t play that game.

**We don’t just promise to “protect” data — we refuse to take it in the first place.**

That means:
- No accounts
- No analytics
- No ads
- No trackers
- No data (or metadata) transmitted

## ✅ On Your Device
Any app preferences or favorites are stored **only on your device** and never leave it. We do not even use iCloud for this app. This choice is simply to assure you completely that your information stays on your phone.

## 🔗 External Links
If you open external links (e.g. Zoom, Maps), your use of those services is governed by their respective privacy policies.

## ❤️  Age Rating
This app is **rated 18+ (16+ in Brazil, 19+ in Korea)** per Apple App Store guidelines. It is not designed for children or minors.

## 🔄 Changes
Any future changes to this policy will be made openly, in advance, and always consistent with the Traditions and Concepts of MA, especially the principle of guarding anonymity.
