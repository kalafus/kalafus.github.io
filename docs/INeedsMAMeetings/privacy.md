# Privacy Policy — I Needs MA Meetings
**Effective: August 16, 2025**

---

## ✅ No Collection
We do not collect, transmit, or share any personal information. We interpret the second part of the Eleventh Tradition — “We need guard with special care the anonymity of all fellow MA members.” — as binding us never to do so.

That means:
- No accounts
- No analytics
- No ads
- No trackers
- No data (or metadata) transmitted

## ✅ On Your Device
Any app preferences or favorites are stored **only on your device** and never leave it. We do not even use iCloud for this app. This choice is simply to assure you completely that your information stays on your phone.

## 🔗 External Links
If you open external links (e.g. Zoom, Maps), your use of those services is governed by their respective privacy policies.

## ❤️  Age Rating
This app is **rated 18+ (16+ in Brazil, 19+ in Korea)** per Apple App Store guidelines. It is not designed for children or minors.

## 🔄 Changes
Any future changes to this policy will be made openly, in advance, and always consistent with the Traditions and Concepts of MA, especially the principle of guarding anonymity.
